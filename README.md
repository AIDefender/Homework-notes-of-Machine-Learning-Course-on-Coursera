Author: Zheng H. Xue, Nanjing University.            
This reponsitory includes source codes of the homework and notes of the 
Machine Learning Course on coursera. Notes are all taken down by me, while
the homework codes are largely written by Andrew Ng and his team, except
the graded part which is shown in the files.            
The homework are all Matlab source files(.m).
